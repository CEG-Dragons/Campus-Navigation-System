# **Campus Navigation System**

## Project Description
A Navigational System that helps a user to find the shortest path to his/her destination from any starting point within the campus using C++ Data Structures, Graph algorithms and Graphics. User is asked to enter the source and destination after which the shortest path is shown to the user in terms of directions("Left","Right","Straight") along with a graphical representation of the path. The Campus data is stored in the form of text files. This Navigation System can be implemented for any kind of campus such as schools,colleges,offices,libraries etc. We have chosen our college CEG as an example.
